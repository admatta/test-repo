The final output will give the data frame with variables


activity - description of the activity for which measurements are taken
values include: WALKING
, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
, SITTING
, STANDING
, LAYING


subject - it is id of one of the 30 subjects on which the study was conducted
values include: 1,2,3,4.......28,29,30 i.e. from 1 to 30

Other variables are the average of the measurements on the mean and standard deviation measurements for each measurement.
The set of variables include:
